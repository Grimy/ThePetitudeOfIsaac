This mod replaces 14 of the default challenges with new ones, where you have to fight Hush or Mega Satan with The Lost using powerful synergies.

The new challenges are:

* #1: Fan of Knives
* #2: King of Spiderses
* #3: One Tear Man
* #4: Armaggedon
* #5: Is Scarification Painful?
* #6: Ludovico’s Technology
* #7: Rings of Light
* #8: Reset Until Blue!
* #9: Tiny Huge Planet
* #10: Best Friends
* #11: Press Space to Win!
* #12: Epic Pony Time
* #13: Gold Runner
* #14: Glass Cannon

Note that only the default names appear in the game. Also note that challenges ending at Hush show Mom’s icon instead.
